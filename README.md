# AsanaDataDrivenTest
Data-driven test to validate Asana functionality


1. Introduction: The purpose of this project was to develop test cases driven by JSON data, validate specific elements on the specific project folders and perform specific tasks on Asanaâ€™s login page.
  
    
(My thought process: When creating tests for unfamiliar websites, I start  out with the simplest, most descriptive way to test the page. This allows me to understand basic functionality and interactions of the page. You will notice that I created three separate tests and with each test, it becomes more concise. Tests from longest to shortest are asanatest.spec.js , asanadatadriven.spec.js, asanadatadriven2.spec.js)


2. Implementation Details: How you tackled the task and the main components of your
implementation.

  - Systematic Approach
          - Test Preparation: Defined test cases in JSON format.Each test case included                 unique identifiers and data for test execution (left navigation items, card                 titles, associated tags, and target columns). 
          - Test Framework: Used Playwright testing framework
          - Test Suite: Structured the suite to include a login test and individual data-                driven test cases.
          - Test Automation: For each data-driven test case we navigated to the specified               left navigation items; Validated the presence of card titles in their                        designated columns; and verified the display of associated tags for each card. 


3. Challenges and Solutions: Mention any obstacles encountered and your solutions.
    - Challenge #1: Little experience creating data-driven automation tests i
    Solution#1: I utilized youtube and LinkedIn learning for some guidance.
  
- Challenge #2: Verifying tags. Verifying tags was challenging because they're displayed in     a concatenated format
    Solution #2: Joined tags into a single string to match displayed content, allowing 
    confirmation of their presence.

    - Challenge #3: Complex left navigation paths with multiple items
    Solution #3: split and iterated through these items clicking on each on to ensure            accurate navigation.


4. Results: Conclude with the outcomes of the test runs, detailing any failures.
    -  All test cases passed (finally)
    -  Initially, I had issues with the login tests because getByRole, getByLabel, and             getById were not available contrary to what the record and playback displayed. Once
       I used locator(), I had no further issues. (Line 68 in asanadatadriven2.spec.js)


5. Recommendations: 
    -  Expand test coverage for different environments
    -  Continuous testing: implement CI/CD pipelines to automation execution on a regular          basis to ensure new code changes does not introduce regressions
